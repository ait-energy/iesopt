This section of the documentation is auto-generated from the code of the Julia-based core model. Refer to [IESopt.jl](https://github.com/ait-energy/IESopt.jl) for any further details (which may require some familiarity with Julia).

**If you spot incorrect math-mode rendering**, or similar issues, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ait-energy/iesopt/issues), since rendering documentation from Julia to Python is not the easiest task.
