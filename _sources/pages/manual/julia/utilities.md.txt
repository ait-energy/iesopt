# Utilities

This section of the documentation is auto-generated from the code of the Julia-based core model. Refer to [IESopt.jl](https://github.com/ait-energy/IESopt.jl) for any further details (which may require some familiarity with Julia).

**If you spot incorrect math-mode rendering**, or similar issues, please [file an issue](https://github.com/ait-energy/iesopt/issues), since rendering documentation from Julia to Python is not the easiest task.

### Functions

#### `annuity`

```julia
annuity(total::Real; lifetime::Real, rate::Float64, fraction::Float64)
```

Calculate the annuity of a total amount over a lifetime with a given interest rate.

_**Arguments**_  

* `total::Real`: The total amount to be annuitized.

_**Keyword Arguments**_  

* `lifetime::Real`: The lifetime over which the total amount is to be annuitized.
* `rate::Float64`: The interest rate at which the total amount is to be annuitized.
* `fraction::Float64`: The fraction of a year that the annuity is to be calculated for (default: 1.0).

_**Returns**_  

`Float64`: The annuity of the total amount over the lifetime with the given interest rate.

_**Example**_  

Calculating a simple annuity, for a total amount of € 1000,- over a lifetime of 10 years with an interest rate of 5%:

```julia
# Set a parameter inside a template.
set("capex", IESU.annuity(1000.0; lifetime=10, rate=0.05))
```

Calculating a simple annuity, for a total amount of € 1000,- over a lifetime of 10 years with an interest rate of 5%, for a fraction of a year (given by `MODEL.yearspan`, which is the total timespan of the model in years):

```julia
# Set a parameter inside a template.
set("capex", IESU.annuity(1000.0; lifetime=10, rate=0.05, fraction=MODEL.yearspan))
```

#### `timespan`

```julia
timespan(model::JuMP.Model)::Float64
```

Calculate the total timespan (duration, time period, ...) of a model in hours.

_**Arguments**_  

* `model::JuMP.Model`: The model for which the timespan is to be calculated.

_**Returns**_  

`Float64`: The total timespan of the model in hours.


---

#### `yearspan`

```julia
yearspan(model::JuMP.Model)::Float64
```

Calculate the total timespan (duration, time period, ...) of a model in years. This assumes that a full year has a total of 8760 hours.

_**Arguments**_  

* `model::JuMP.Model`: The model for which the timespan is to be calculated.

_**Returns**_  

`Float64`: The total timespan of the model in years.
